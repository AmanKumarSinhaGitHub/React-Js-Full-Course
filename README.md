# Resume Builder

Create a simple static React app for a Resume Builder. The app should consist of components for Resume, Skills, Education, and Experience, with data provided through a JavaScript object.

```js
const details = {
  name: "Aman Kumar Sinha",
  experience: [
    {
      year: 2023,
      company: "xyz",
      role: "Frontend Developer",
    },

    {
      year: 2022,
      company: "abc",
      role: "Backend Developer",
    },
  ],
  education: [
    {
      year: 2020,
      college: "Sahyogi High School",
    },

    {
      year: 2023,
      college: "R.N. College",
    },
  ],
  skills: ["react js", "node js", "express", "mongodb"],
};
```
