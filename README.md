# React To-Do List App

A simple and responsive To-Do List app built with React.

## Features

- **Add tasks:** Easily input and save new tasks you want to remember or complete.

- **Mark tasks as completed:**
  Indicate when a task is finished to keep track of your progress.

- **Delete tasks:**
  Remove tasks from your to-do list if you no longer need them.

- **Reorder tasks:**
  Change the order of tasks by moving them up or down for better organization.

- **Persistent Storage:**
